answer,commentary,"This is a case of **subarachnoid haemorrhage**.\n\nSubarachnoid haemorrhage refers to bleeding in the subarachnoid space, and is a\n**medical emergency**. If you do not treat subarachnoid haemorrhage, patients\nare at risk of **permanent neurological damage** (due to cerebral infarction),\n**shock** (due to bleeding) and **death** (due to both!). Subarachnoid\nhaemorrhage usually occurs because an **aneurysm bursts** in the brain.\n\nSubarachnoid haemorrhage is typically characterised by:\n\n1. A **sudden-onset**, severe headache often described as like a **thunderclap** and "the worst headache in my life"\n2. Altered mental state such as **reduced consciousness** or **loss of consciousness**\n3. **Meningismus** (signs usually associated with meningeal inflammation) such as **neck stiffness**, **photophobia**\n4. Sometimes **focal neurological deficits** due to cerebral ischaemia\n5. Diplopia, such as due to compression of the abducens nerve (from raised ICP) or the oculomotor nerve (directly from an aneurysm)\n6. **Sentinel headaches**, which are sudden severe headaches indicating small haemorrhages\n\nYour management approach should be to **confirm SAH** and engage **early contact with the neurosurgical team** to secure a bleeding aneurysm.\n\n1. Stabilise the patient using a typical ABC approach\n2. Obtain an urgent CT scan of the head to confirm SAH\n3. Immediately consult with the neurosurgical team\n4. Monitor frequently for deterioration (hourly neuro obs, )\n5. Provide analgesia for the patient's comfort (paracetamol or codeine would be appropriate)\n6. Give **nimodipine**, a calcium-channel blocker which reduces the risk of vasospasm that could exacerbate cerebral ischaemia\n"
