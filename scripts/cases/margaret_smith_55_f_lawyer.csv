**RE: Margaret Smith (DOB: 05/08/1964) **

---

Thank you for seeing Margaret Smith, a pleasant and high-functioning 55-year-old lady who came to my clinic this morning with a **severe headache**. She was unable to describe her symptoms to me clearly today and appeared in an acute state of distress. As her primary practitioner, this concerned me greatly given that Margaret is usually highly articulate. I have referred her to your service for urgent assessment and management. 

On examination today, her HR was 76bpm, BP 160/110, RR 14 and T 37C. There were no abnormal findings on neurological examination.

Her past medical history and usual medications are listed below.

## Past Medical History

answer,commentary,"Margaret has a **subarachnoid haemorrhage** (SAH). 

Subarachnoid haemorrhage refers to bleeding in the subarachnoid space, and is a **medical emergency**. If you do not treat subarachnoid haemorrhage, patients are at risk of **permanent neurological damage** (due to cerebral infarction), **shock** (due to bleeding) and **death** (due to both!). Subarachnoid haemorrhage usually occurs because of bleeding from an **aneurysm** in the brain: any condition which increases the risk of cerebral aneurysms (such as **polycystic kidney disease**) also increases the risk of subarachnoid haemorrhage. 

Subarachnoid haemorrhage is typically characterised by:

1. A **sudden-onset**, severe headache often described as like a **thunderclap** and 'the worst headache in my life'. This may often be the only finding. 
2. Altered mental state such as **reduced consciousness** or **loss of consciousness**.
3. **Meningismus** (signs usually associated with meningeal inflammation) including symptoms such as **neck stiffness** or **photophobia**. This can occur because blood breakdown products can irritate the meninges.
4. Sometimes **focal neurological deficits** due to cerebral ischaemia.
5. Sometimes diplopia, such as due to compression of the oculomotor nerve by an aneurysm.
6. **Sentinel headaches**, which are sudden severe headaches indicating small haemorrhages prior to rupture, or other changes such as thrombosis or dissection in the aneurysm.

**Any patient with a sudden-onset severe headache** should be suspected of SAH. 

Your management approach should be to **confirm SAH** and engage **early contact with the neurosurgical team** to secure a bleeding aneurysm.

1. Stabilise the patient using an ABC approach
2. Obtain an urgent non-contrast CT scan of the head to confirm SAH
3. Immediately consult with the neurosurgical team
4. Monitor frequently for deterioration in meantime (e.g. hourly neuro obs)
5. Provide analgesia for the patient's comfort (paracetamol or codeine would be appropriate)
6. Give **nimodipine**, a calcium-channel blocker which reduces the risk of vasospasm that could exacerbate cerebral ischaemia (with decent evidence behind its usage). Patients are sometimes also given ""prophylactic"" stool softeners to reduce straining, as this can induce fluctuations in blood pressure and bleeding. 
7. Control blood pressure, typically systolic between 110 and 160 mmHg, such as with IV labetalol. Don't go too low as cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) may decrease and provoke cerebral ischaemia if mean arterial pressure drops too low. 

If the head CT is negative, then do a **lumbar puncture** if there is still significant clinical suspicion of SAH. The lumbar puncture will classicaly show **xanthochromia** (blood breakdown products in the CSF) in SAH."
